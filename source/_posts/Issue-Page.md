We have a new responsive issue page for published expositions! This makes it possible to group expositions and display an issue on a particular theme etc. as one entity on the RC. Expositions belonging to a certain issue are grouped and each issue has a thumbnail image and a description. All (published) issues are visible on the portal profile page. By default, however, issue pages are not publicly visible.
