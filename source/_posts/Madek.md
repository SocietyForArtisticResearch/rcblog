We now have our first connection to an external repository: ZHdK's *Medienarchiv der KÃ¼nste* (Madek) <https://medienarchiv.zhdk.ch/>.  In the "Media"-tab on the right hand side of the workspace editor there are three subtabs: "Simple Media", "Works" and "+".  Clicking "+" opens a tab where you can establish a link to your Madek account.

In order to establish a connection to your Madek account, please go to https://medienarchiv.zhdk.ch/my/tokens and create a new token with reading permissions. Once the token is created please copy it into the respective text field on the RC.  Now you can use any of your publicly visible media files from your Madek account. You drag them onto the workspace editor and they will be copied including title, subtitle, copyright owner and description.
