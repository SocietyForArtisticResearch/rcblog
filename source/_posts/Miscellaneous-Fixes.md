Over the last months we have fixed a number of smaller issues:
- Content using iframes can now use microphone and camera input.
- Footnotes of restored snapshots can now be edited.
- Allow full screen of embedded content.
- Improved republish reviewing workflow for already published expositions.
- We fixed a problem with large lists of footnotes not being scrollable.
