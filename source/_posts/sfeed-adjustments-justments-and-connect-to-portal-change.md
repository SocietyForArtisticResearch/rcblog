We have adjusted feeds, they now include DOI and issue number

Further we made two adjustments to the connect to portal function: 

expositions which are private can no longer be connected to a portal, it has to be shared in some manner (within the portal, RC or with the public). This to avoid the situation where a user shares (by accident) a private exposition, which would not even be visible to the admin nor to anybody else.

Also, the share status is now visible to portal admins under "connection requests", so it is easier to find out who can see an exposition.
