For portal admins:

It will soon be possible to put an exposition that is being reviewed “in revision”. Once "in revision"  this means the author can change the content, but the exposition remains in the list on the reviewing page (so the admin can keep track of the progress).

For complete documentation, go to [revision entry in the RC extended guide](https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#in-revision)
